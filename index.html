            <P id="pa">
                Many of the members who are currently part of The Hive Mind, met in another guild of the game server. They formed a group so unique that they decided to grow and share their experience in a new guild, previously known as The KirLuDru Resistance. The name came from the people who took the step to this new
                phase,Drutaa: the guild master (GM); Kirsty: the right hand and the best raid leader (RL); and Luxur: a loose cannon but with a heart of paladin. They decided to create KirLuDru, a guild where the respect, the help and the fun are encouraged. It was difficult to start and grow, but with the help of all the
                officers we got what we have now, The Hive Mind, where we are all one and we try to offer everything on our power. Our officers are the best, whom the Queen placed all her trust in them to grow the hive and the members who are part of it; and for those who do not know them, they do not what they are missing.
                The veteranwith whom the guild was formed are Kzha: if you see any of his arrows, please return them; Sanitarium: the priest that of sacred has -1; and many more members who have become a very important pillar in the hive.
