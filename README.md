The objective of this projects is to help and assist guild members and to welcome new guild members.

The website is to help guild members with guides and videos to progress with in the game content and recluitment, having all the information and tools in the samen website, will give to the member a fast access to a high end content, so they can enjoy the game instead of searching for information else where.

The goals of this website are:

The members visit this website to:

# UX
My idea with this website is to make visually very atractive and funcional, the navigation is very eye catching with a nice touch color contrast and images background.

- Someone that wants to be  better at the game.

The project help users to:

- Navigate easy throughout the whole site with out loosing track of anything

## User stories:

1. As a new user the contrast with the black and yellow color is really nice, make you feel like you are inside of a Hive full of bees.
2. the images on the header and body are epic, Home, raid and raider, have a different image related to the content.
3. The links to a guides with diffent website and classes logos are brilliant.
4. videos are a nice touch as the guild always are looking for videos of how to kill bosses and having all toguether is a great idea.

raiders information.

## Surface

The logo is place to the left to have a better vision of it, the navigation bar are place to the right to have better feeling on navigation and a clear idea of where to focus your atention.
the color contrast yellow and black is giving the impresion of a honey bee  making the name and brand very atractive, the images are mainly focus on the game most popular characteres at this time.
Is have a nice soft hover (aqua) color to make the website more about the content and little details also it doent kill the idea behing of the honey bee.
the font family I use make the fonts getting out of the desing as call very much the atention, as they are very easy to read.
