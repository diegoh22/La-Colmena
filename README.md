# UX
Most gaming website are more focus on presentation of the own content without giving any extra tools to make the navigation easy, as they are oveload with information.
My idea with this website is to make visually very atractive and funcional, the navigation is very eye catching with a niche touch color contrast and images background.
also have a good presentation of who they are as a guild, and very much focus on the game content, so went you navigate the website you feel that you still in the game.

## Ideal Users
The ideal Users for this site is:

- English speaking
- In love with gaming
- idea of Word of Wardcraft
- Need fo improving in the gaming word

The project help users to:

- Navigate easy throughout the whole site with out loosing track of anything
- get knowlegd about guild, members, raids, raid bosses, and classes guides.

## User stories:

1. As a new user the contrast with the black and yelow color is really nice.
2. the images on the header and body are epic every sesion ,Home,guides,raid and raider, have a different image related to the content.
3. The links to a guides with diffent website and classes logos are brilliant
4. videos are a nice touch as the guild always are looking for videos of how to kill bosses and having all toguether is a great idea.

## Scope

To achieve the strategic goals, I included the following features in the website:

- Header containing Guild logo and the menu bar including Home, Guides, and Raid and raiders.
- Home page which say about the guild server and Horde facition.
- guild history where they come from and who they are.
- Footer containing the sing in button, and links to discord and a copyright text.
## Skeleton
The website consists of three pages; Home (introduces to the guild history, server and faction), Guides (show videos guides to boss encounter and navigation links for each class of the game), and Raid and Raiders (Have progetion and times for the raid, and a presentation of the raid members with links conected to they character information).

## Surface

The logo is place to the left to have a better vision of it, the navigation bar are place to the raid to have better feeling on navigation and a clear idea of where to focus your atention.
the color contrast yelow and black is giving the impresion of a honey bee or bumble bee making the name and brand very atractive, the images are mainly focus on the game most popular characteres at this time.
Is have a nice soft hover (aqua) color to make the website more about the content and little details also it doent kill the idea behing of the honey bees.
the font family I use make the fonts getting out of the desing as call very much the atention of readers, as they are very easy to read and the view doent make you lose your concentration.
